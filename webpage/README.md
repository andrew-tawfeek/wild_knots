# Infinite Grid Tiles - Modular Webpage

This is a modularized version of the infinite grid tiles application, split into organized files for better maintainability and development.

## Key Features

### High-Quality Mini Representations
- **4x Resolution**: Mini representations are rendered at 4x the display resolution (232x232px) and scaled down to 58x58px for crisp, high-quality display
- **PNG Compression**: Uses maximum quality PNG encoding (`toDataURL('image/png', 1.0)`)
- **High-Quality Rendering**: Utilizes `imageSmoothingQuality: 'high'` for superior image scaling
- **Anti-Aliasing**: Proper anti-aliasing ensures smooth edges and clear details

### Modular Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each JavaScript file handles a specific aspect of functionality
- **Maintainable Code**: Easy to modify individual features without affecting others
- **Extensible Design**: Simple to add new features by extending the InfiniteGrid prototype

## File Descriptions

### HTML & CSS
- **index.html**: Clean HTML structure with modular script imports
- **styles.css**: Complete styling including high-quality image rendering properties

### JavaScript Modules
- **grid-core.js**: Main grid class, tile creation, and rendering logic
- **event-handlers.js**: All user interaction handling (mouse, touch, keyboard)
- **tile-operations.js**: Tile selection, copying, pasting, and number application
- **nested-grid.js**: Entering and exiting nested grids with level management
- **mini-representation.js**: High-quality canvas-based mini representation generation
- **ui-controls.js**: Toolbar creation and UI element management
- **main.js**: Application initialization and global utility functions

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use the toolbar tiles (0-10) or keyboard input to set tile values
3. Double-click any tile to enter its nested grid
4. Create patterns within nested grids
5. Click "Exit Tile" to generate high-quality mini representations
6. Use copy/paste (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V) for pattern replication

## Technical Improvements

### High-Quality Rendering
- Canvas resolution: 4x scale factor for crisp detail
- Image smoothing: High-quality interpolation algorithms
- PNG encoding: Lossless compression with maximum quality
- CSS rendering hints: Optimized for high-quality display

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient image loading with caching
- Asynchronous canvas operations
- Minimal DOM manipulation during updates
- Smart visibility culling for large grids

## Testing

Use `quality-test.html` to see the difference between standard and high-quality mini representation rendering. The test demonstrates the visual improvement achieved through high-resolution canvas rendering.

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with Canvas 2D support
- High-quality rendering features supported in:
  - Chrome 50+
  - Firefox 51+
  - Safari 10+
  - Edge 79+
